# Practice problem 5 Outlined in realpython.com
# Given a string in SDM format, described below, write a program to find and return the solution for the sudoku puzzle in the string. 
# The solution should be returned in the same SDM format as the input.
# Some puzzles will not be solvable. In that case, return the string “Unsolvable”.
# For our purposes, each SDM string will be a sequence of 81 digits, one for each position on the sudoku puzzle. 
# Known numbers will be given, and unknown positions will have a zero value.
